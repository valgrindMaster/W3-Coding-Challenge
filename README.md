## Setup

### Client

Assuming Server is already running (see **server** section below):

1. On command line, navigate to `client` directory and run `npm install`.
2. Run `npm run start` to host webapp. If app doesn't launch automatically, navigate to `localhost:3000` in a modern browser.

### Server

1. On command line, navigate to `server` directory and run `npm install`.
2. Run `npm run start` to host server (on port 4000).

## If I had more time...

Between my full time job, interviews, and various take-home assignments, I'm honestly a bit burnt out.

Unfortunately, I was not able to entirely complete the requirements of this take home assignment, namely I didn't get to:

- Add at least one unit test.
- Clean up CSS styles.

Optimizations that could have been made include:

- Improve separation of concerns in ZipInfo, component feels a bit too large and seems like it could benefit from a refactor.

## Things that I'm proud of

- Bonus requirements implemented
- Utilized local storage to persist search history on page reload.
